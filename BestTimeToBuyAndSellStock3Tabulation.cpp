/* Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max 2 Transactions Allowed
   In daily share trading,
a trader buys shares and sells them on the same day.If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

                                                                                                                          You are given an array prices[] representing stock prices throughout the day.Note that the second transaction can only start after the first one is
                                                                                                                          complete(buy->sell->buy->sell)
                                                                                                                              .

                                                                                                                          Examples :

    Input : prices[] = [ 10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80 ] Output : 87 Explanation : Trader will buy at 10 and sells at 22. Profit earned in 1st transaction = 22 - 10 = 12. Then he buys at 5 and sell at 80. Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 5 = 75. Total profit earned = 12 + 75 = 87. Input : prices[] = [ 2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80 ] Output : 100 Explanation : Trader will buy at 2 and sells at 30. Profit earned in 1st transaction = 30 - 2 = 28. Then he buys at 8 and sell at 80. Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 8 = 72. Total profit earned = 28 + 72 = 100. Constraints : 1 <= prices.size() <= 105 1 <= prices[i] <= 105
